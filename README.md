# Clickup CSS Mini Project
## This is my submission for the ClickUp's CSS mini project.

The instructions given are as follows:

*Turn the design into responsive html/css.*
*Submit your work to bls@clickup.com, aaron@clickup.com, konstantin@clickup.com, and alex@clickup.com.*

*Here are some guidelines:*
1. [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/key-concepts/)
2. Pure html/css. We do not use Bootstrap as well as other exterior frameworks.
3. Any preprocessor at your choice. We use SCSS.
4. We're looking for pixel perfect and attention to details.
5. Using grunt/gulp/webpack will be a benefit.

**FAQ**
*We do not use REACT*
*If you would like to work on in-app projects, you must showcase your JS skills and make the carousel functional*
